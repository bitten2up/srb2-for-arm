# srb2-for-arm
srb2 2.2.9 for arm

check armsrb2setup to compile and install depencys and srb2compile to compile after running armsrb2setup also put it in the source folder

to run lsdl2srb2 download https://github.com/STJr/SRB2/releases/download/SRB2_release_2.2.9/SRB2-v229-Full.zip extract it into the folder you downloaded lsdl2srb2 then run it. if that doesnt work try installing the depencys with 
```bash
sudo apt-get -qq -y --no-install-recommends install git build-essential libpng-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libgme-dev gettext ccache wget gcc upx openssh-client libopenmpt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

hope it works
